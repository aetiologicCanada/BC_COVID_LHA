# BC_COVID_LHA

The purposes of this repo are:  1) to scrape the names of the Local Health Areas, Health Service Deliver Areas and Health Authorities from the BCCDC website. (You might think this unnecessary) 2) To generate and populate weekly counts from the png file.

Files will be saved as csv, in the /data folder with filenames YYYY_MM_DD.csv where the date is the date of the associated report.
